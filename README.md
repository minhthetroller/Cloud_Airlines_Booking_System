## üìñ About The Project

**Cloud Airline Booking System (CABS)** is a web application that simulates a real-world airline booking platform. It allows users to search for domestic flights, select seats from an interactive map, and complete their booking as either a guest or a registered member.

This project was developed as a practical application of system analysis, design, and implementation principles, focusing on a modern, serverless-first architecture to ensure a great user experience and developer productivity.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Flight Search**: Search for one-way or round-trip domestic flights based on destination and date.
* **Interactive Seat Selection**: Visually select available seats from an aircraft map based on the chosen ticket class.
* **Secure User Authentication**: Full registration and login system for members, powered by Supabase Auth.
* **Booking Management**: Members can view their complete booking history and cancel upcoming trips.
* **Transactional Emails**: Automated booking confirmations and password reset emails are handled by Resend.
* **Responsive Design**: A clean and intuitive UI that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
