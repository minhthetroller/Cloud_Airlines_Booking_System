Cloud Airline Booking System (CABS)

This repository contains the source code for the Cloud Airline Booking System (CABS), a comprehensive web application developed as a course project for "System Analysis and Design". CABS is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive flight booking experience for users.

The platform allows both guests and registered members to search for flights, select seats from an interactive map, and complete their bookings through a secure payment process. The system is built to support essential airline operations from the customer's perspective, including user registration, account management, and viewing booking history.
